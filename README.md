# Explore_BlackTwitter

I had heard of BlackTwitter, but since I'm not a big social media user I wanted to explore whether the idea and voices of BlackTwitter
necessarily lives under that particular hashtag.
So I set out to answer the question… Can analyzing tweets with variations of the hashtag “blacktwitter” give us a view into a black collective voice? 
And if so, what is it saying?

This python analysis will pull tweets with the #BlackTwitter tag, and proceed to explore the data.
The csv files are the original tweet data that was pulled and used in this analysis.
